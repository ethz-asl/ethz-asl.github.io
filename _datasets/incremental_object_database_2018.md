## Dataset Description

- Raw sensor data plus Tango-generated poses
- Example (three_chairs_teaser_20180301_040531.bag): 2:12 duration, 4.9 GB; topics include RGB, depth, fisheye, IMU, and transforms
- Multiple object-rich scenes with repeated instances to enable matching and completion; red regions in visualization indicate filled unseen parts
