This dataset provides several real-world laser scans for testing and benchmarking **laser registration** and **outdoor localization** algorithms. The sequences include diverse outdoor environments containing buildings, vegetation, and long-range structures, suitable for evaluation of alignment, ICP-style registration, and mapping techniques.

## Data Access

The dataset is now hosted permanently on the **ETH Research Collection**:
