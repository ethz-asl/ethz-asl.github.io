The IR ICRA 2014 dataset provides visual–inertial recordings designed to evaluate **illumination-robust monocular visual odometry and SLAM** algorithms. It contains challenging sequences with significant lighting variations, fast exposure changes, and difficult low-light conditions that commonly occur during indoor and outdoor flights of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs).

These sequences are useful for benchmarking:

- illumination-robust feature tracking
- monocular/multimodal VO under high dynamic-range conditions
- visual–inertial fusion methods
- exposure-robust perception and real-time onboard estimation
